AboutAbout
Have you ever wondered what keeps modern vehicles running safely and reliably — even under extreme conditions?

What role do engineers play in turning futuristic ideas into real-world breakthroughs — the kind that make vehicles safer, smarter, and more reliable every day?

I’m Malek Abdelrhman, a Software Development Engineer specializing in automotive software, embedded systems, and system testing. I’m driven by curiosity, precision, and the challenge of turning complex ideas into reliable, safety-critical systems.

My journey began at Ain Shams University, where I earned my B.Sc. in Computer & Systems Engineering and completed a Siemens-sponsored thesis on fault-tolerant AUTOSAR OS for multicore platforms. This work became the foundation of my first IEEE publication, presented at NILES 2024.

Today, I work at Micro Engineering Tech Inc. (METI) as an Autonomous Vehicle Software Tester, where I:

- Design and execute system, functional, and regression tests

- Build scenario-based simulations for AV behavior validation

- Automate Python-based test generation

Ensure autonomous systems behave safely, predictably, and reliably across environments

Every test case I design is written with one goal in mind: to make autonomous mobility safer and more dependable.

Beyond the technical scope, I believe in continuous learning, communication, and leadership — skills shaped through years of leading student teams and working within fast-paced engineering environments.

Looking ahead, my goal is to advance as a technical leader in automotive and autonomous systems, helping shape software that defines the future of safe mobility. I want to keep pushing boundaries — not just to build systems that work, but systems that think, adapt, and protect.

If you share that passion or are looking for someone who can bring technical depth, attention to detail, and real-world reliability to your team.
